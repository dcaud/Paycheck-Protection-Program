So, I merged and cleaned the files and then but them into a database so that others could find them more easily.\nOther sites have done similar things, notably, ProPublica has an excellent site of PPP data. However, we add some value:\nThe data here is newer (by about 5 months)\nIt includes exact amounts (instead of ranges).\nWe may include more data. The raw data includes loans under $150k, unlike other sources. However, as is, a lack of computer processing power makes it so that this website only serves up a fraction of the records that have the highest loan amounts. When I have more time (and can pay for time on a multi-core supercomputer) I’ll add more records.\nNote that currently the search functionality is limited. But I’m working to make it better.\nSo ProPublica is great, and may be more comprehensive. So check them out!\n\n\n\n",
