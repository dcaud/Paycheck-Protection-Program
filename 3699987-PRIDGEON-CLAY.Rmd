The **Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)** was designed to provide a direct incentive for small businesses to keep their workers on the payroll. It ended in August 2020, but a [new PPP bill](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/529092-bipartisan-support-for-new-ppp-loans-gains-momentum-in-congress) is being considered.

As part of the Paycheck Protection Program **PRIDGEON & CLAY, INC** received a loan.
